### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am an experianced backend developer with over 10 years of cumelative freelance experiance as a backend engineer. On top of that, I have about 6 years of corporate work experiance. 

I have worked in many technologies and thrive to learn new technologies as the world moves on to next things. Some areas I have worked on :- 

- Java (Springboot, Play framework), 
- Python (Django)
- PHP (Wordpress, Joomla, Codeignighter, Zend-framework, Slim, Laravel etc), 
- NodeJS (Express, NextJS, NestJS, Prisma, TypeORM, Sequalize, Mongoos, AngularJS, VueJS), 
- Dotnet Core 6/7 (Both on windows and Linux), 
- Android (Java/Kotlin).
- Database (Postgresql, Mongodb, MySQL, SQL Server, Sqlite, CockroachDB, Amazon DynamoDB, Redis, Memcached)

In addition to above, I have training and hands-on experiance in Bash scripting, LUA scription and windows and linux administration, both in personal life and professional life. I have also mentored young souls to get in love with programming and open source.

I am a linux guy at heart. Loves working with open source stuff. I was core maintainer of Fedy, got the project directly from its author, and maintained it until the project was accepted into RPM Fusion repos at around 2015. Since then I have contributed on many project mainly around testing and publishing of apps on various linux distros.


- âœ¨ In 2023, I have worked on 
    - Backend Platform (NestJS, TypeORM) A business rule engine, backend api written in Typescript. API platform contains Roles and Privileges management, Authentication Middleware, Organization and Suborganization management. Database was Postgres and used TypeORM to interact with it. API was consumed with a react frontend project. Notable point of this platform is in how it manages to maintain a UI state in its backend with help of APIs. Activity pipeline and 
    
    - Backend Platform (ExpressJS, Sequalize, Apollo GraphQL) Another application backend written in Typescript. Uses Sequalize to interact with Postgres Database and Graphql API for realtime updates to front-end. The application is intended to be used by wholesellers and wherehouses to discover, buy and sell their stocks. Notable point of this platform is geo-location based searching, stock listing and realtime chatting between buyer and sellers.
    
    - PHP to Dotnet migration. Rewriting an entire application from an ancient PHP codebae to modern Dotnet platform. Due to differences in the nature of two platform, this is a unique experiance as primary requirement of the project is to maintain absolute backward compatibility in terms of API interaction, so that existing clients are not affected by this migration. Which means exorbant usage dynamic types and manual mappings in C# models, so that we could emulate PHP's loosely typed nature in API request response signature, while still maintaining C#'s strict type nature in business logic.
    - Mongo to Postgres migration: This was a NextJS project on a medical vendor contracts domain. Their core db was mongo, and they wanted a PoC on few scenerios on wether it would be possible to migrate db from schemaless nosql to RDBMS. On top of that, I also worked on streamlining their contract workflows and calculations. I also developed advance analytics with mongo graphs, reporting tools and various implementation of Financial projection formulas. We also worked on a backend tooling to manage internals of the platform, including csv datadump management.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working as a Principle Backend Engineer for an exciting startup. The core stack is in NodeJS. But the thing I am looking forward in this job is to learn about DevOps. I feel that this was the missing link that I need to learn in order to reach my dream of becoming a Solutions Architect in future. 

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Golang. I intend to switch to mobile development as next stage in my career. Although there is a big wishlist of things I want to learn in 2023
  -  -  [x] Flutter.
  -  -  [x] Deno (Oak framework)
  -  -  [x] Bun (BETH Stack)
  -  -  [ ] Tauri.
  -  -  [ ] Rust.
  -  -  [ ] SvelteKit
  -  -  [x] AstroJS (Learn about Island Architecture).

- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on 
    - The IDE project: It is collection of Neovim config and Emacs Config files, to create your perfect lightweight IDE
    - Ogma: An amazing ebook reader and personal library management software for all the bookworms like me.
